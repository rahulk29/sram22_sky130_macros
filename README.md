# SRAM22 SKY130 SRAM Macros

## Overview

This repository contains SRAM macros that are generated using [SRAM22, an SRAM generator developed at UC Berkeley](https://github.com/rahulk29/sram22).
To unzip all GDS files, run

```bash
./unzip.sh
```

## Verification

The macros provided here have not been verified in silicon; use them at your own risk.

We are working to tape out and characterize these macros, and will announce when we believe they are ready for general use.
