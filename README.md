## Overview
This repository contains SRAM macros that are generated using [SRAM22, an SRAM generator developed at UC Berkeley](https://github.com/rahulk29/sram22).

These configurations were generated for use in [Chipyard](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard.git) designs 
in their VLSI tutorial with Sky130 and [commercial tools](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/VLSI/Sky130-Commercial-Tutorial.html) and [OpenROAD tools](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/VLSI/Sky130-OpenROAD-Tutorial.html).
These tutorials are in progress, and should be released in the beginning of March 2023.

## Verification

The macros provided here have not been verified in silicon; use them at your own risk.

We are working to tape out and characterize these macros, and will announce when we believe they are ready for general use.
